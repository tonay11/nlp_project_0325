03042	12	This is Coco. At first I thought she was a cloud but clouds don't bork with such passion. 12/10 would hug softly 
03041	14	This is Carlton. He's being hailed a hero for saving the life of a dog in need. A dog named Breeze (frame 3) didn't have enough red blood cells for an exploratory surgery to identify an internal injury. Carlton's rescue heard the news and called on him for a blood donation. He was on his best behavior during the procedure. The timely transfusion allowed Breeze to get his life-saving surgery, and it wouldn't have been possible without Carlton. Breeze's human is so grateful for their hero and asks anyone interested to contact @renegadepawsrescue about adopting Carlton. He was abandoned last year as a puppy and is more than ready for his forever home. We're covering his adoption fee. 14/10 
03040	13	This is Carolina, Dawson, Claudia, and Cecilia. They are just 4 of a litter of 9 puppies who contracted parvovirus before being rescued.

03012	13	This is Jupiter. She loves her rope toy but hates the idea of having to go anywhere without it‚Ä¶ so she swallowed it. Had to have emergency surgery to remove it. We covered the cost of her care, and both she (and the toy, somehow?) are expected to make a full recovery. 13/10  This week we were sent 103 GFMs totaling $623,219 in requested funds. We sadly can‚Äôt feature them all. Please consider getting a quote from @trupanion through the link in our bio (third one down from there), so you never have to send us your GoFundMe. It‚Äôs best to be puppared ‚ù§Ô∏è #partner

02977	14	This is Fezco. Sadly, you read that right. He was abandoned by his previous owners for being ‚Äúgay‚Äù after he humped another male dog. It didn‚Äôt take long for the story to make national headlines and eventually be seen by Steve Nichols and his husband, John Winn. They told @nbcnews they‚Äôve been together for 33 years, and in those 33 years, have faced the same ignorance and bigotry that put Fezco back in the shelter. They decided they were going to do something about it, and adopted Fezco earlier this week. His new caretakers aren‚Äôt convinced he‚Äôs gay, ‚Äúbecause he hates having his picture taken and what gay person doesn‚Äôt want their picture taken?‚Äù He‚Äôs since been renamed Oscar, after legendary gay playwright, Oscar Wilde. 14/10 for him and his new humans

02840	15	This is Smoky. She was World War II‚Äôs littlest soldier. In 1944, a U.S. soldier found a young Yorkshire Terrier in an abandoned foxhole in New Guinea and named her Smokums. The four-pound pup was sold for just two Australian pounds to Corporal William Wynne, who shortened her name to Smoky.  Smoky served with Wynne in the Air Force, and she was awarded 8 battle stars for her brave acts. She joined on combat flights, backpacked through jungles, survived a typhoon, and once parachuted 30 feet through the air in a parachute made just for her (frame 3). She famously helped repair a damaged communications center by crawling 70 feet through an 8-inch wide culvert with a telegraph wire attached to her collar, saving 250 crewmen from a dangerous 3-day dig.  One day when Wynne was hospitalized with dengue fever, members of Wynne's squad smuggled Smoky in to see him. After a nurse asked if the dog could visit other patients, Smoky began a new task of cheering up sick soldiers. When the war ended, returning soldiers were ordered to leave pets behind, but Wynne smuggled Smoky stateside in an oxygen mask case. Back home, Wynne and Smoky continued to tour hospitals, putting on shows with Smoky's tricks to lift the spirits of recuperating soldiers. She knew how to play dead, walk a tightrope, and even ride a handmade scooter. In 42 live TV performances, she never repeated a trick.  After Smoky died in 1957, Wynne buried her in a World War II ammo box and frequently visited her resting place until he passed away in 2021 at age 99. Smoky is the first therapy dog on record and the first dog to be honored with the Animals in War & Peace Distinguished Service Medal, the highest award American animals can receive. We‚Äôre giving Smoky our highest honor too: a 15/10 (courtesy @ahistoryofdogs)

02748	13	This is Ellie Mae. She was bit by another dog as a puppy and had to have her leg amputated. Even though she's perfectly content with life as a tripod, it means she has a preexisting condition that might deter an owner from pet insurance. But her new owner got a 30-day @trupanion offer anyway, and good thing: Ellie Mae had a tooth abscess and a broken toe, all within about a month of signing up. Fortunately, they covered her care, including casting and X-rays, and her owner continued her plan. Now Ellie Mae and her owner can both rest easy knowing they're covered for new procedures and any emergencies she can't outrun. Thank you @elliemaebabygrey for sharing your #TrupanionTail with us. 13/10  Emergencies happen all the time, and vet bills can add up quickly. Even if your pet has a preexisting condition, you can ask your vet about Trupanion's exam day offer to see what a 30-day offer would cover. #partner

Rogers is a volunteer dog walker and professional photographer who takes adoptable dogs on adventure photoshoots to show potential adopters how outdoorsy and adorable they are.   ‚ÄúI started as a volunteer dog walker years ago with the intention of posting the adoptable dogs on Instagram. I had no idea how well it would be received or how significant it would be in finding the perfect family for seemingly 'unadoptable' dogs.""  Now she volunteers with ""over 30 rescues (mostly southern Alberta but also a few across Canada and west coast USA)"" and has taken ""300 or 400 dogs (lost count!) for day adventures."" Many of hernewfound friends have found their forever homes this way, ""and then I get to follow a lot of them in their forever lives on social media so my whole feed is daily updates of these once-homeless friends.""  She says her mission with each shoot is to showcase the dogs' personalities. ""For every weirdo dog, there‚Äôs a weirdo human out there who has been waiting their whole life to meet that dog."" As for whether she's decided to keep any of them for herself? ""I found my own monster Anna through volunteer dog walking. üòÅ She‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve ever adopted.‚Äù 13/10 for all (courtesy @trailsandbears) "

""A weekend at a secluded campsite ended up resulting in a small puncture in the back of his throat, most likely from the stick he was chewing on at the campsite. Trupanion was able to pay my vet directly. Our experience using our policy was a breeze, so I was able to walk out of there knowing we were covered and was able to get Wylder home and resting after his slight sedation to clean out his wound instead of filling out and filing paperwork. We plan for the worst, but having Wylder under a Trupanion policy gives me relief. I would absolutely recommend Trupanion to every dog owner. One simple plan that covers so much and makes it so easy for us to go out and live our lives with peace of mind is a no-brainer.""  Thank you @rachloden for sharing your Trupanion Tail with us ü§ó "

But despite the meds and the prescription diet, he didn‚Äôt get better. He had no energy, his fur was matte, and he was underweight.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIn the summer of 2021 we started with JustFoodForDogs, and that‚Äôs when Frank‚Äôs recovery began.

The unidentified golden retriever came barreling out of the house for pets, interrupting the burglar long enough to have him put the bike back temporarily and pet the dog‚Äîa testament to the breed's charm but perhaps not their guard dog capabilities.  In the video shared by the local police department, the suspect can be heard praising ""the coolest dog I've ever known"" and seen giving the pup belly rubs, even saying ""I love you"" before fleeing with the three-speed bike valued at $1,300. The dog is all tail wags before watching the guy ride away on the bike. That is when they realized maybe they'd been bamboozled.   The dog's pursuit was unsuccessful, but we're still giving them a 14/10 for the attempt. (credit @sandiegopd) "

To get the allergies under control, his human went looking for a diet that would provide all the nutrients Niko‚Äôs body would need to fight off the solar dermatitis flares. That‚Äôs when she discovered @justfoodfordogs.   After just six weeks on their new diet, Niko showed fewer signs of rash irritation from all his allergies. It was clear his quality of life had improved dramatically with the switch. He can now get back to more important things, like cuddling as close as he possibly can to Keiko. 14/10 for both @justfoodfordogs #partner (thank you @keiko.and.niko for sharing your story with us) 
01783	13	We‚Äôre excited to announce our partner @Trupanion is now available through @StateFarm! And here are some dogs dressed like @jakefromstatefarm to celebrate. 13/10 for all

01780	12	This is Carl. He's very powerful. 12/10 don't mess with Carl (vine by Sam Enright)

01749	13	This is Jiho. He was found with his mother and siblings in the woods of Asan, South Korea. His siblings were rescued, but Jiho and his mom were left behind due to his congenital deformities. His mom would spend her time searching for food to bring back to Jiho, and one day she never returned. After a week alone, Jiho made his way to the city shelter, where he was given 10 days to be claimed. The rescue @bandforanimal pulled him from the shelter and he eventually made his way to a foster home in Portland, Oregon. He‚Äôs made progress with his mobility under the care of @wildheartspdx and his foster family, but now that he‚Äôs old enough, it‚Äôs time for surgery to amputate. This will greatly improve his quality of life and set him up for success with potential forever homes.

He‚Äôs 13/10 and you can help him feel all better by clicking the link in our bio 
01733	13	This is Smidgen. She was rescued from a backyard breeder situation. During her first vet visit, they discovered a heart murmur, and the following echocardiogram results were devastating.

But if he did happen to do something naughty like that, he's glad that @trupanion would be there for him in an emergency. You know, hypothetically. 13/10 #partner  ""Keith broke his leg at 7 months old during a dramatic game of fetch. You never know when unexpected expenses will arise,"" says his mom, ""and I wanted to make sure that no matter what, Keith would receive the very best medical care. Trupanion has made that happen. The entire process is simple; from getting the quote, to signing up, to submitting claims. They even paid the veterinarian directly so there was no need to wait for reimbursement! The best part for me was Trupanion‚Äôs incredibly friendly and helpful team. They clearly understand the love we have for our pets, and they managed to make a very hard situation a lot easier. Pet insurance is the best way to show our pets how much we care, and anybody who wants a simple process from a supportive team who truly cares about their pets should choose Trupanion!""

But you know what else they have? @Trupanion to help manage the cost of their care and, of course, each other. 13/10 for both #partner  ‚ÄúBoth my girls came to me with pretty severe pre-existing conditions that I was prepared to pay for when adopting them. But I'm so thankful for having Trupanion because of the plethora of other conditions that have come up since then, from food allergies and seasonal allergies to visits to the ER 3 nights in a row for a 4-inch gastric foreign body in her composed of all the things she'd been licking off the floor, including some pieces of cat tree she ate! Because of Trupanion covering the entire thing, I was able to focus my energy on her and not have to make any difficult decisions based on what was in my bank account.  ‚ÄúMy dogs mean everything to me, and I could not live with myself if I ever had to make the decision to say goodbye or let one of my animals suffer because of finances. So YES! I would definitely recommend Trupanion to others! No owner should EVER have to make a decision about their pet's health and longevity based on their access to resources. Pets are family and they deserve to receive gold standard care when needed.‚Äù  Thank you @beagdealzumma for sharing your Trupanion Tail with us ü§ó

01671	14	This is Tilly. He‚Äôs proof that it's never too late to find your dream job. In June 2021, the border collie mix was on a road trip with his family when another car hit their SUV, ejecting Tilly through the rear window. Thankfully no one was seriously injured. But, likely startled, Tilly ran from the scene. Tilly's parents, Linda and Mike Oswald, chased after him, but couldn't keep up. The Oswalds spent the next 10 hours searching for Tilly, sometimes alongside complete strangers who joined the search effort. Linda later posted about the ordeal on Facebook, desperately asking for help finding their beloved pup. Much to the Oswalds‚Äô relief, a farmer commented on the Facebook post that they had spotted the pup herding sheep on their farm. After luring Tilly away from the sheep with salami, they gave him to a local sheriff who reunited Tilly with his overjoyed family. After two days of pursuing a new career, Tilly had lost some weight and was very thirsty, but was otherwise fine. Tilly's instincts most likely drew him to the farm and took over completely when the opportunity to herd sheep presented itself. Linda thinks that if he wasn't found thanks to the kindness of strangers, he would have simply never stopped herding. We‚Äôre giving Tilly and his beefed-up r√©sum√© a 14/10.

01521	13	"""We got our pupper, Casey, from the Hamilton County Humane Society 1 year ago. She came to the shelter as a stray dog who was pregnant and eventually had 13 puppies who were adopted quickly, but she was left behind. When we got her we could tell she had been physically abused. She was petrified of any sudden movement, whether it was towards her or simply near her. Casey would cower if somebody approached her too quickly and yelp in pain if she felt scared. One year later, she is doing much better. Her confidence has gone up tremendously and she is almost a normal dog. She will always be emotionally scarred due to those early years, but she has made great strides. I hope that this story gets shared. I want people to understand that emotionally scarred dogs are not damaged beyond repair. They can be some of the most lovable dogs you meet. I'm so glad we could give Casey a new home and I hope this story inspires others to not ignore dogs because of a background they can't help. Thanks for all you do!  Best Ruffgards, Lily S"" 13/10 "

01455	15	This is Hachik≈ç. He was an Akita born on Nov. 10, 1923 in Japan. He was sold to Hidesaburo Ueno, a scientist at the University of Tokyo. Ueno named him Hachi after the number 8, which is considered lucky in Japan, and the two became inseparable. Every day, Hachi walked to Shibuya Station with Ueno for his commute, and he returned each evening to pick him up. This routine continued daily until May 21, 1925. On that sad day, Ueno left for work and never returned, after suffering a fatal cerebral hemorrhage while lecturing.  Despite Ueno's absence, Hachi continued to wait for him at the station daily. Hachi bounced between several homes, including some miles from Shibuya, before settling with Ueno‚Äôs former gardener. No matter the distance, Hachi returned to the station daily to wait patiently for his owner. In 1932, a former student of Ueno‚Äôs published an article about the dog's vigil, and Hachi's story blew up. Hachi became a symbol of loyalty, and ‚Äú-ko,‚Äù a suffix used as a sign of respect, was added to his name. Now called Hachik≈ç, he started receiving pets and treats from people at the station while he awaited his owner.  In 1934, a life-sized statue of the loyal dog was erected at Shibuya Station, and Hachik≈ç himself attended the unveiling ceremony. Hachik≈ç died the next year at the age of 11. Each year since 1936, a solemn ceremony at Shibuya station has been held to honor his devotion. Hachik≈ç's ashes were buried beside Ueno‚Äôs in Tokyo. After nine years, nine months and fifteen days, Hachik≈ç was finally reunited with his beloved owner he missed so much. For his perseverance and loyalty, we bestow upon Hachik≈ç the extremely rare (and long overdue) 15/10 ‚ù§Ô∏è (courtesy @ahistoryofdogs)

When I lost both my 15 year old Golden Retrievers, I knew I had to get another (my 4th) rescued Golden. However, I had moved to a very rural area of Northern California and the closest rescues were 5-6 hours away. Through social media, I was able to find a group in the Lodi/Sacramento area that gets dogs from Taiwan. Apparently, there are many many abandoned Goldens on the streets. There is a large facility/rescue that takes the dogs in and gives them much needed medical care and love. Then they fly them to SF for adoption. Bert came to us as ""Robert"", all skinny and allergic to everything in the woods here but we got that all straightened out. And he immediately became ""Bert"". He is the most lovable, kissable and just plain hilarious boy. He jumps, all 4 legs up at every single ball game, any and all food, hikes and walks, naps on the big bed with us, and every time someone says ""who's a good boy"". Everything delights him and he is interested in everything we do. He loves vacuuming and lawn mowing especially. He loves the snow when it's not too deep. This winter was a drag but he did just fine. Talk about a happy ending!  We are his peeps, he is our boy.  Sorry to send so many pictures. I can't help myself.  Sincerely,  Mary Adams Bert's mom"" 13/10 "

Normally insurance paperwork is a nightmare, but it's an easy peasy process with Trupanion.""  Thank you @gill_thegolden for sharing your Trupanion Tail with us ü§ó "

01418	14	This is Rocky. He gets a little wild when his humans have friends over, so they distract him with squirrel videos. 14/10 
01417	13	This is Mudge. She woke up one day with a severely swollen face. A grass awn had punctured the roof of her mouth and infected her muscle tissue.

01400	14	This is Sicily. She‚Äôs quite rare. Professionally, I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs a mix between Big Bird and a baboon. Truly an honor to be in her presence. 14/10 
01399	14	This is Winston. He was born with both an underdeveloped sternum and front arms. His ribs aren‚Äôt connected to anything right now so his chest is not properly protected. He needs a series of significant reconstruction surgeries, and he‚Äôs growing so fast he needs a new set of wheels every other week. He is a super happy pup who doesn‚Äôt know anything‚Äôs wrong and you can help him and his rescuers by clicking the link in our bio. 14/10 (he also just made a piglet friend named Wilma) [EDIT: fully funded in 71 minutes]

We sadly can‚Äôt feature them all. Please consider getting a quote from @trupanion through the link in our bio (third one down from there), so you never have to send us your GoFundMe.

01389	14	This is Frida. She was found paralyzed in the middle of a busy street in Thailand. Her rescuers sponsored her medical care for several months before bringing her back to the states with them. With extensive physical therapy, a @justfoodfordogs diet, and a whole lot of love, Frida is doing wonderfully.  Paralyzed dogs like her often face frequent bladder infections, skin issues, and inflammation, but a fresh whole food diet of @justfoodfordogs has kept her happy and healthy. #partner  She inspires her humans every day, and it‚Äôs an honor to share her story with you.

01357	13	466 golden retrievers gathered in Scotland last week at the exact spot where the first golden puppies were born 155 years ago. They were bred by aristocrat Sir Dudley Marjoribanks, at Guisachan House in Glen Affric. He wanted a gun dog that was also suited to Scottish Highland terrain. The first puppies born at the house were named Primrose, Cowslip and Crocus. The gathering last week was to keep alive knowledge of the breed. Sources have confirmed it was the largest and cutest gathering of goldens to date. 13/10 for all (photo courtesy of Sandra Mailer, video credit Darren Stocker via Storyful)

01348	14	This is Pickles. He became an international hero in 1966 when he found the World Cup Trophy after it was stolen.  The heist made global headlines and incited panic amongst London's Metropolitan Police. The police even received a ¬£15,000 ransom note together with the removable lining from the top of the trophy.‚Å†‚Å£  Seven days later, David Corbett and his dog Pickles were on their routine walk when Pickles started sniffing under a bush. Wrapped in newspaper, and just hidden enough to avoid discovery, was the World Cup. David ran back to his wife to tell her the news to which she replied ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt look very world cup-y to me.‚Äù  The police soon confirmed it and Pickles was an immediate hero. England went on to win the World Cup that year and Pickles was invited to the winner‚Äôs banquet at a five star hotel where he promptly peed in an elevator. He was probably just a little nervous.   Pickles went on to be named ‚ÄúDog of the Year,‚Äú which came with free food for a year, then he got an agent, and starred in the 1966 film ‚ÄúThe Spy with a Cold Nose.‚Äù  In September of 2018, a plaque was placed near where Pickles found the trophy. 14/10 @ahistoryofdogs

Scientists are stumped, but one thing is certain: it would be an honor to pet them. 14/10 for both (thank you @pingoeninadalmatians for helping us with April Fools this year üòå)

Shelter staff nicknamed her ""Calm Love"" due to her calm temperament despite her health struggles. Timid at first, she was quick to open up with staff and volunteers and snuggled up with her human buddy on her freedom ride from the shelter. X-rays revealed a very large bladder stone that requires immediate removal. Unfortunately, she is unable to undergo anesthesia while she has pneumonia.

Amanda had been photographing her throughout her entire life, and when she passed, she decided to post a photo from puppyhood beside one from her senior years. The reaction to it was incredible, and Amanda began reaching out to previous clients whose dogs she photographed as puppies. The result was the #DogYearsProject. She estimates she's done this with 65-70 dogs and has no intent of stopping. ""I think people can relate to the visible aging process that the images show...

00838	13	This is Mako. He takes his duties as captain of the ski pawtrol very seriously. Was pupset to find a distinct lack of powder on the mountain during his last trip. Turns out his @trupanion coverage protects against many things‚Ä¶ just not the seasons changing.   ‚ÄúA normal day of playtime at the river resulted in Mako being rushed to the emergency vet. Mako caught a fish hook in his paw, which tore through his pad and cut an artery. We rushed him to the closest emergency vet. He had already lost a lot of blood. We‚Äôre so thankful for having gotten Trupanion pet insurance for Mako. They paid their portion to the vet directly before we even got Mako back home. Having insurance made us less worried about bills, and able to focus on Mako healing. I highly recommend Trupanion pet insurance; it paid for itself with one visit to the emergency veterinarian. His health is very important, not just because we love him. He is a working service dog and needs to be at his best in order to task for me‚Ä¶ when he isn't working he is quite an adventure dog.‚Äù 13/10 #partner (thank you @makatothemalamute for sharing your Trupanion Tail with us)

Not only did Buford suffer from severe dermatitis but he also had a heart condition that his vet believed was likely caused by a dietary deficiency. Buford was promptly started on the JustFoodForDogs Chicken & White Rice recipe.  The results were immediate. According to Jo, after his first week on JFFD, Buford‚Äôs skin issues dramatically improved. It has now been over a year. Buford‚Äôs hair has grown back completely.

00681	14	"The Dog Who Thought the Parade Was for Him (because it was). This photo was taken by @yuriyurisky on March 24, 2012, and immediately started circulating around the internet. ""I feel that dogs are present in all parts of life. A dog appears where you least expect it,"" said Yuri. He was in Mexico covering Pope Benedict's first ever visit to the country. ""As we waited we looked for signs that he was about to show up or not, watching his security‚Äôs movements to try to guess if he was going to appear. That's what was happening when I saw that a dog had come across."" That's right, a little dog decided to steal the Pope's parade. ""I imagine that in that moment he was impressed by the people who cheered with flags, who threw confetti, and all that, and he began to run. He started running in the center of the street. I focus on him and start to take photos. I shoot photos of him, and I shoot and shoot and shoot, following him until he‚Äôs out of the way. Later I discover the photo where he turns to see the crowd and he looks up, and‚Ä¶it gives the impression that he's greeting the crowd‚Ä¶"" Not much is known about the dog in the photo.

It even included a bear previously owned by Elvis. One fateful night, Barney and his security guard human, Greg, were on duty guarding the teddy bears. Greg was admiring one in particular, saying what a nice little bear it was, when Barney went on a rampage. For 10 straight minutes, with Greg chasing him around, Barney absolutely shredded 100 teddy bears. Greg said perhaps Barney became jealous of how he spoke to that one bear, as Barney had been a model guard dog until then. After the massacre, dogs were no longer allowed in the exhibit, and Barney has since retired from his guard dog duties.

I am more than happy to donate to this cause, and to help out The Shelter Project too!  Attached, please find a picture of my two shelter dogs, Nora (the black/white husky/border collie) and Charlie (the red merle border collie). My husband Dan and I adopted them last year from All Herding Breed Dog Rescue (Lockport, IL). Charlie had been waiting for a home for months but because he is blind people were reluctant to adopt him. We met him and he melted our hearts. These two were a wonderful addition to our home.  In March of this year, Dan passed away suddenly. Without Nora and Charlie, I would have been a hopeless mess. Aside from the practical effects (you can't lie in bed all day when the dogs need walks and breakfast and dinner), having these guys in my life has been a blessing. Having dogs to welcome you home and snuggle up to you on the sofa (and hog the bed!) has made me feel needed and loved. I wouldn't trade them for the world!  Thanks again for your efforts.

Bindi's mom says. ""The staff have been so personable, and it feels more like I'm talking to my long lost friend on the phone rather than a representative. I truly feel like I'm part of the family rather than 'just another customer.' These people care about your pets like they're their own.  ""I started looking for insurance right away and chose Trupanion because of their wide range of coverage, low premiums, and ease of submitting claims. When getting a miniature dachshund, getting pet insurance was a no-brainer for me. Along with all the typical possible reasons to need insurance, dachshunds pose another reason to have it. Their unique long bodies make them prone to IVDD, and while we hope to never face that nightmare it's such peace of mind to know that if we do, Trupanion will have Bindi's back‚Ä¶ quite literally.""

When I switched to JustFoodForDogs, Winnie became excited about eating again. She'd wait by her bowl at mealtimes, which isn't something I'd ever seen her do. Making the transition from canned food to JFFD, we'd mix the two together. Winnie would meticulously lick and spit out the canned stuff and only eat the JFFD!

00112	14	This is Troubadour. He has been a loyal companion and service dog to his human, Katie, for over a decade. He works as her mobility and medical alert dog.  Katie always wanted a dog growing up, but her parents were afraid they wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford emergency vet bills. When she adopted Troubadour, she immediately began researching medical insurance for her pet. She soon found @trupanion and enrolled him right away. ‚ÄúWith all of the amazing care and love Troubadour has provided me over the last ten years it was an incredible relief that when he needed medical care himself, I didn't have to worry about affording the best possible care for him. I was able to focus on spoiling him rotten.‚Äù  Troubadour recently developed a large liver tumor and Katie knew surgery was his best chance. ‚ÄúI hate to think about it, but if I hadn‚Äôt had Trupanion, I would not have been able to make the same decision. I could have maybe tried fundraising for his surgery, but even then, the quote I was given for Troubadour‚Äôs surgery was far less than what his final bill amounted to.‚Äù Troubadour had excessive bleeding during his surgery to remove the tumor.. He survived but with significant blood loss. He needed multiple platelet infusions for the next five days. With every phone call Katie received from the hospital asking if she agreed to another bag of platelets and the associated cost, she was able to say yes. ‚ÄúYes, I can give him everything he needs!‚Äù   ‚ÄúTroubadour is now cancer free, happy, healthy and fully recovered just a few months later. I still have my best friend and service dog because of Trupanion and the incredible veterinarians and technicians who played a role in saving his life.‚Äù 14/10 #partner (Thank you Katie for sharing Troubadour‚Äôs story with us.
