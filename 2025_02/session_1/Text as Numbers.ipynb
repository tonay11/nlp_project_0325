    "### Removing punctuation duplicates\n",
    "We can see lots of tokens have trailing punctutation, and a good few of these will also exist in without the punctuation. This duplication is bad for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "We would want these to be the same token so we can use a **regex** to replace it. The regex below splits on whitespace (represented by `\\s`), hyphen (`-`) or punctuation (`.,;!?()`) that appears at least once (using this plus notation `+`). We immediately see the size of the vocabulary drops by about 25%, showing there was loads of duplication in our bag of words. "
