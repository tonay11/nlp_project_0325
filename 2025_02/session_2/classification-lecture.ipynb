Probably.  Is not now?  Debatable.  What other valid test can\\nyou think of besides the final standings or divisional playoff winner?  What\\ndo you propose, a worthless vote like they do in college football?  What a\\njoke!\\n\\n&gt;You Boston fans make me laugh: you're going crazy based on a very \\n&gt;recent Boston domination over Montreal in the playoffs. I mean how \\n&gt;many cups has Boston won compared to Montreal's 23? And who do you \\n&gt;think is going to win the **next** cup between the 2 teams? Montreal \\n&gt;or Boston? You know Sinden's going to find some way of screwing up \\n&gt;even this good Boston team. He'll fire Suter or trade away a vital \\n&gt;star. (Admittedly, his last few trades have been good ones but how \\n&gt;long before his luck runs out and he starts making Esposito-for-\\n&gt;Ratelle type trades again?) \\n&gt;\\n\\nIf I remember right, Brad Park was also involved in that trade.  He wasn't\\nall that bad a hockey player.\\n\\nBut let's look at some of Sinden's trades over the years:\\n\\n??? for Rick Middleton (Rangers).  I don't know who Sinden gave up for Middle-\\nton, so I'll call this one a +.\\n\\nBarry Pederson for Cam Neely (Canucks).  +++.  Any questions?\\n\\nGreg Hawgood for Vladimir Ruzicka (Oilers). ++.  Didja see that one Rosie\\nroofed against Roy in last year's playoffs?\\n\\nCourtnall/Ranford for Andy Moog (Oilers).  A wash.  Moog is a good goaltender,\\nRanford burned Boston in the Finals in his first year, and Courtnall always\\nseems to get his points.  Anyone in Vancouver care to comment on Courtnall\\nas a defensive liability?\\n\\nKen Linseman for Dave Poulin (Flyers) ++.  Any more questions?\\n\\nJanney/Quintal for Adam Oates (Blues).  ++.  Janney is an enormous talent and\\na personable guy, the the Bruins play in Adam's Division.  Enough said?\\n\\nSo,even if you count the Esposito/Vadnais/Ratelle/Park/I don't remember who \\nelse (Joe Zanussi?) trade as a double minus, Harry the Horse trader comes\\nout on top.  I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry, not\\nin spite of him.\\n\\nBTW, do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season.  I'll bet \\nthey finish fourth or fifth in the Conference, behind any of the following:\\nPittsburgh, Quebec, Boston, Washington, Islanders.  Someone correct me if\\nthese five teams will not be in Montreal's conference.\\n\\nIn summary, things look bleak for the Habs, at least in the near future.  I\\nsuspect that the next team from La Belle Province to win the Cup will be\\nthat team that Lindros didn't want to play for.\\n\\n&gt;I admit that I've been suffering lately with the Boston gets hot while \\n&gt;Montreal swans in the playoffs type years. But I **do** have the sure \\n&gt;knowledge that the Montreal braintrust will keep plugging away until \\n&gt;they hit the right formula for yet another cup. Whereas if I were a \\n&gt;Boston fan, I'd have this kind of despair that as long as Harry Sinden \\n&gt;is running the show, the Bruins will always be good but **never** \\n&gt;good enough.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;- Jack\\n\\n-- \\nDan Lyddy    daniell@cory.berkeley.edu    University of California at Berkeley\\n\\nMy Two Favorite Hockey Teams:  1) The Boston Bruins\\n                               2) Whoever's playing Pittsburgh\\n</td>\n",

The fans wouldn't take it !\\n&gt; They rather see their teams out of the playoffs most of the time or even \\n&gt; relegated than merged.  It's not that difficult to understand, it's just \\n&gt; like here in Helsinki.  You *grow up* being either a Jokerit- or HIFK -fan.\\n&gt; The other team is the last team in the world you would support.  I'm not \\n&gt; talking about 'hate' but about extremely deeply rooted rivalry.\\n\\n\"Deeply rooted rivalry?\" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined\\nthe top flight only in the early '70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since\\n1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think\\nyou're exagerating here.\\n\\n&gt;    However, it's been proved that both fan groups can cheer the same team\\n&gt; - that's \"the Finnish national team\".  Maybe that's how you could set up a \\n&gt; huge franchise in Finland.  No one has ever said that the team must be \\n&gt; called after one city or play all its games on one arena.  Just one Team \\n&gt; Finland and Team Sweden in the NHL just wouldn't make any sense - we have \\n&gt; way more talent than 1/24th of the total of North American talent.  After a \\n&gt; couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the \\n&gt; Nordic  (presuming that our teams would have the advantage in  drafting \\n&gt; local talent, as prooposed).\\n\\nThat's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &amp;amp;\\nAmerican Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our\\nset of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about\\nas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean\\nBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in\\nthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn \\nMcEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been \\n3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the \\nKings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled\\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \\nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\\n---\\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish &amp;amp; Swedish players gradually end up\\nwith Helsinki &amp;amp; Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\\nno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \\nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\\n\\n(28-30=superstar)\\n(23-27=star)\\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\\n(13-17=NHL regular)\\n( 8-12=role player)\\n\\nFINLAND:  \\n\\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\\n\\nC-Jari Kurri........25\\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\\n\\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\\n\\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\\n(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\\n\\nSWEDEN:\\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\\nD-Calle Johansson...18\\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\\n\\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\\nC-Thomas Steen......18\\n\\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\\nR-Michael Nylander..13\\n\\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\\nL-Jan Erixon........14\\n\\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's\\nSelanne &amp;amp; Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's\\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh &amp;amp; co. have. But\\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's\\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at\\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\\n---\\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top\\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \\nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\\nisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\\nwon't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \\nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \\ncouple of years the same way Edmonton's \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late '80s. \\nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \\nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a \\ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \\nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \\nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \\n\\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n&gt;  J O O   J O O   J O K E R I T  !  !  !

Hathaway \\n\\nThe problem is no-one seems to have the exact numbers.  When the mission\\nwas planned originally at 3 spacewalks,  and 3 astronauts,  there was\\nenormous concern over the mass margins for the flight.  THey\\nhave now planned for 5 EVA's,  an 11 day mission and have 2 reserve\\nEVA's and an emergency EVA.  Obviously that is coming from somewhere.\\nMy guess is the OMS burn  fuel,  or  re-boost  margin.   \\n\\nI just figured, if GOldin wants to really,  prove out faster, cheaper\\nbetter,   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable\\nspace manuevering tug  out of a BUs1,  and use that for the re-boost.\\nit has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck.\\n\\npat\\n\\n   \n",

There's\\n: presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at\\n: the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\\n: that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\\n\\nWow, now, it looks like you don't like our players? What about guys like:\\nNieminen, Jutila, Riihijarvi, Varvio, Laukkanen, Makela, Keskinen and (even\\nif he is aging) Ruotsalainen? The main difference between finnish and North-\\nAmerican players is, that our players tend to be better in the larger rink.\\nThe Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe. \\nAnd I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck (though\\nthey helped). I think that the main reason was, that the team worked well\\ntogether.\\n--\\n***********************************************************************\\n* 'Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl* \\n*  howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh'  *\\n*                                       -Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz       *\\n***********************************************************************\\n\\t-Marko Poutiainen\\n\\t mep@phoenix.oulu.fi\\n   \n",

Didja see that one Rosie\\nroofed against Roy in last year's playoffs?\\n\\nCourtnall/Ranford for Andy Moog (Oilers).  A wash.  Moog is a good goaltender,\\nRanford burned Boston in the Finals in his first year, and Courtnall always\\nseems to get his points.  Anyone in Vancouver care to comment on Courtnall\\nas a defensive liability?\\n\\nKen Linseman for Dave Poulin (Flyers) ++.  Any more questions?\\n\\nJanney/Quintal for Adam Oates (Blues).  ++.  Janney is an enormous talent and\\na personable guy, the the Bruins play in Adam's Division.  Enough said?\\n\\nSo,even if you count the Esposito/Vadnais/Ratelle/Park/I don't remember who \\nelse (Joe Zanussi?) trade as a double minus, Harry the Horse trader comes\\nout on top.  I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry, not\\nin spite of him.\\n\\nBTW, do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season.  I'll bet \\nthey finish fourth or fifth in the Conference, behind any of the following:\\nPittsburgh, Quebec, Boston, Washington, Islanders.  Someone correct me if\\nthese five teams will not be in Montreal's conference.\\n\\nIn summary, things look bleak for the Habs, at least in the near future.

The 1992 Olympic teams contained about\\nas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean\\nBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in\\nthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn \\nMcEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been \\n3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the \\nKings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled\\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \\nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\\n---\\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish &amp; Swedish players gradually end up\\nwith Helsinki &amp; Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\\nno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \\nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\\n\\n(28-30=superstar)\\n(23-27=star)\\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\\n(13-17=NHL regular)\\n( 8-12=role player)\\n\\nFINLAND:  \\n\\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\\n\\nC-Jari Kurri........25\\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\\n\\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\\n\\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\\n(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\\n\\nSWEDEN:\\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\\nD-Calle Johansson...18\\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\\n\\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\\nC-Thomas Steen......18\\n\\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\\nR-Michael Nylander..13\\n\\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\\nL-Jan Erixon........14\\n\\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's\\nSelanne &amp; Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's\\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh &amp; co. have. But\\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's\\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at\\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\\n---\\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top\\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \\nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\\nisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\\nwon't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \\nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \\ncouple of years the same way Edmonton's \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late '80s. \\nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \\nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a \\ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \\nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \\nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \\n\\n> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n>  J O O   J O O   J O K E R I T  !  !  !

    "### Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Models don't have to be constructed with machine learning. The model is simply something that when given an **input**, which in our case waill be some vectorised text, it is able to produce some **output**. In the case of **classification** this will always be a single discrete label. \n",
    "\n",
    "This model could be made by hand, and in fact some text classification models were made by hand until quite recently. However, this can be time consuming and complicated, and result in models which are not particularly robust. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning allows us to make **models** from **data**. This means that given **new data** that the model hasn't seen before, we can assign a new label to that new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Whats the simplest data-driven model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets think of the simplest model we can make, using the data we have. For example, we could get 50% accuracy by just picking the same class every time without even looking at the data. Generally, we would hope to be doing better than **mean** or chance!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do much better than that using **learning algorithms** to generate our models in a process called **training**. We will cover a couple of learning algorithms used for classification later in the lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of our dataset is quite simple. Each example (in our case each text document), is represented by 1 or more numbers. This might be a Bag of Words Vector, a TF/IDF vector, or a Topic Model Vector, or some other representations we'll learn about later on in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **input**. Each example also has a label, or an **output**. This label tells us which class the example belongs to and we can use this to **train** our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Labels\n",
    "A quick word on labels in classification tasks. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discrete (https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/discrete-vs-continuous-data/)\n",
    "- Categorical (not numerical, although we often use numbers). 1 is not less than 2, 3 is not half 6. \n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "### Training \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we take the dataset (the input that represents each example, and its accompanying label), and generate a model that will learn to take new inputs, and be able to correctly label them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way this happens is often starting from some random initialisation, we iteratively try each example, check if we got it right by comparing the model's prediction against the actual label, and then use this information to improve the model. Eventually, we end up with a model that works well (hopefully!). \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms we'll look at today actually don't really have much of a training process as such, unlike the more fancy learning algorithms we'll look at later in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "### New Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we've trained the model, its time to try it out on some new data! Remember, the goal is to make something that is able to correctly label new data (new instances of text) based on what it has learned about the categories from the dataset. It is worth noting here that models will only tend to be good at identifying new examples that are similar, or at are least different in similar ways, to the ones it has seen before.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look into how to evaluate our models later on. "

    "### Evaluating Models \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Set Accuracy\n",
    "Training set accuracy is when we take all the data we trained the model on and use it to determine the accuracy of that same trained model. It's important to remember that the goal of most traditional machine learning tasks is to take existing examples and produce something which generalises to new examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an issue known as overfitting, a model may have high training set accuracy, but when given new examples will perform poorly. In our text blog example, this means the model has learnt to identify the exact blog posts it has seen before, rather than learning something intrinsic about all space or hockey emails that would allow it to correctly label novel ones under different circumstances in the wild. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation Set Accuracy\n",
    "To get a more accurate measure of accuracy (meta, right?), you can hold back some of your data from training and use this to evaluate your model during development. This way your model is being tested on unseen data and you can have more confidence it will work when you put it into production. Proportions for this split vary, but 10% is often used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with test set accuracy is that you lose some of your precious data for training. Also, if you have small datasets, a 10% split of an already small number of examples may not actually give you much of an idea about how well your model is performing. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that no one method is right for all situations and compromises often have to be made. It's also important to note that these methods will only work as well as your data is good. They won’t, for example, spot bias in your model if your test set also lacks the necessary diversity. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Sets\n",
    "Some people hold back even more data to really test how well their model will work in the real world (or \"production\"). This is because they may overfit to their testing data when tuning their models. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cross Validation \n",
    "Its the best (or worst?) of both worlds approach! More on that later."
