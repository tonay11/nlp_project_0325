# **💡 Extra Challenge: AI Text Remix Battle! 🎭⚔️**  
## **Can You Hack AI Text Generation? 🤖✨**  

Welcome to the **next level** of generative text challenges! 🎮💥  

In this challenge, you’ll **hack** and **remix** the Markov Chain and RNN-based text generators to create **new and exciting text generation experiments!** 🧪🚀  

---

## **🔍 What’s the Challenge?**
You will:
✅ Modify the **Markov Chain model** to generate **rhyming sentences!** 🎤✨  
✅ Train a **mini-RNN** to generate text from your own dataset! 🤖📚  
✅ Combine **Markov + RNN** to create a **hybrid AI poet!** 🏆💡

## **🎯 Challenge 1: Markov Rhyming Poet! 🎶**
### **🔹 Can you make Markov chains generate rhyming text?** 🤯  

Instead of generating **random sentences**, modify the Markov generator to:
- **Match words that end in the same sounds** 🎵  
- **Use a rhyming dictionary** to predict the next word 🔤  

**📝 Hint:** Use the `pronouncing` library to find rhyming words!  

### **🚀 Try this:**
```python
pip install pronouncing
import pronouncing

# Find rhyming words for a given word
word = "star"
rhymes = pronouncing.rhymes(word)
print(f"Words that rhyme with '{word}': {rhymes}")
```

🔗 **Goal:** Modify the Markov generator to always pick **rhyming words!** 🎶

## **🎯 Challenge 2: Train Your Own Mini-RNN! 🧠**
### **🔹 Can you train a simple RNN on a custom dataset?** 🤖  

- Instead of using **pre-trained GPT-2**, train a **small LSTM model** to generate text in a **specific style**! 📚✨  
- Try **training it on poems, Shakespeare, or even your own tweets!** ✍️📜  

🔗 **Hint:** Use **TensorFlow/Keras** to build an LSTM model!  

### **🚀 Try this:**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

texts = ["The moon is bright", "Stars shine at night"]
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)

print("Word index:", tokenizer.word_index)
```

🔗 **Goal:** Train a simple LSTM to generate text! 🤖📖  

---

## **🎯 Challenge 3: The Hybrid AI Poet! 🤯**
### **🔹 Can you combine Markov Chains + RNNs?** 💡  

- **Step 1:** Use **Markov Chains** to generate the **first few words**  
- **Step 2:** Pass the output into an **RNN** to continue the sentence!  

🔗 **Hint:** Try generating text like this:
```
"The enchanted forest whispers..." (Markov)
→ "secrets to the trees, where dreams take flight." (RNN)
```

🎭 **Goal:** Create a text generator that **blends Markov randomness with RNN intelligence!** 🏆✨  

---

## **💬 Discussion Questions**
🔹 What happens when you **increase the order** of the Markov chain? 🤔  
🔹 Does a **hybrid approach** make better text than Markov or RNN alone? 🧐  
🔹 What kind of **custom datasets** would work best for training an AI writer? 📜
